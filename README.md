# Killclack: Join the Movement to Kill the Keyboard

</div>Killclack is an open-source, next-generation coding environmentâ€”built from Void (a fork of VS Code)â€”with a revolutionary twist: full AI-driven, real-time voice interaction.

## Context & Purpose

Built as an open-source voice pored alternative to Cursor for AI-powered codebase exploration and editing, Killclack extends the mission: to kickstart a movement away from keyboard-centric workflows, making code accessible through natural, spoken language. Our vision is to empower everyoneâ€”from seasoned developers to code newcomersâ€”to create, command, and collaborate by voice.

We believe coding should be as natural as conversation.

**Join the movement to kill the keyboard, starting with code!**

## Reference

Killclack is a fork of [Void](https://github.com/voideditor/void), which in turn is a fork of VS Code ([original repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)).

## Note on VOID

Work is temporarily paused on the original Void IDE (the parent repo) while the Void team experiments with novel AI coding concepts. Stay tuned for updates on the Void Discord.
